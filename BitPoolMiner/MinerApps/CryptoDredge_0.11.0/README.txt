SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  * NVIDIA GPUs with Compute Capability 5.0 or above
  * Latest GeForce driver
  * 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended). Some algorithms such as NeoScrypt require the
    virtual memory (swap file) with the same size as all of the GPU's memory.
  * Internet connection

  Windows

    * Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions)
    * Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015:
      https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145

  Linux

    * Ubuntu 14.04+, Debian 8+ (64-bit versions)
    * Package libc-ares2. Installing libc-ares2 package is as easy as running
      the following command on terminal: apt-get install libc-ares2

TROUBLESHOOTING

  1. Antivirus Software Reports

    CryptoDredge is not a piece of malicious software. You may try to add an
    exception in antivirus software you use.

  2. Rejected Shares

    There are many reasons for rejected shares. The primary reasons are:

      * high network latency
      * overloaded mining server
      * aggressive graphics card overclocking

  3. Watchdog

    If you are using a third-party watchdog, you can disable the built-in
    watchdog by using --no-watchdog option.

    Example:

      CryptoDredge -a lyra2v2-old -o stratum+tcp://<POOL> -u <WALLET_ADDRESS> --no-watchdog

  4. Lyra2REv2 Issues

    In case if you have issues with the current implementation of Lyra2REv2
    (lyra2v2), you might want to try lyra2v2-old.

    Example:

      CryptoDredge -a lyra2v2-old -o stratum+tcp://<POOL> -u <WALLET_ADDRESS>

  5. Several Instances After a While

    It seems that you are using an own restart mechanism of CryptoDredge
    (see the "Watchdog" item).

  6. Crash Reporting

    If the built-in watchdog is enabled then CryptoDredge will generate and send
    us the report. You can disable error reporting with --no-crashreport option.
    Allowing CryptoDredge to send us automatic reports helps us prioritize what
    to fix and improve in the future versions.

    Crash reports won't include any personal information about you, but they
    might include:

      * Operating System version
      * Driver version
      * Miner configuration
      * Application crash data
